# Intro
Welcome fellow problem solvers. We've been solving problems for computers by computers through algorithm and data structures. Well, today, we will be solving problems for humans by computers. It's not very technical repo, means that, we might solve certain problem with AI, but we won't get to code right away. It's a bit conceptual repo, so feel free to contribute if you have any nice concepts that solves a certain problem of any developing counry and of course in a cheaper way, you know algorithm efficiency, write some money efficiency today !

## Before you contribute your concept:
- Write a title that links to it's description.
- You must have to have a description.
- Try to make the titles sorted alphabetically.
- And put your tech buzzwords inside back-ticks  `` , like inline-codes.

Thank you.
